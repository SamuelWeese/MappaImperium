# Mappa Imperium

[Mappa Imperium](https://nookrium.itch.io/mappa-imperium) is a great little world building table top game designed Nookrium. You should check it and [his other work out](https://nookrium.itch.io/)!


## This Project

This project (also poorly named Mappa Imperium) is a python based (originally cpp until classes + work took too much time) is an implementation of Mappa Imperium I took the UI I wrote from [my senior design](https://github.com/kharanpv/AI_DnD) and reused it here.


Currently, this project supports:

### Rolling in chat window
- Use /r or /roll {x}d{y}!

### Drawing on screen (WIP)
- Color selection is implemented, but I'm unhappy with it
- Currently only a single width pen is unsupported (and hopefully no one will see this message as I will fix it in the next 48 hours)

### Adding places with custom images (WIP)
- Currently images are supported to the exent they were in the [Jaran Project](https://github.com/kharanpv/AI_DnD). I plan on adding additional options for data storage once I rework drawing and image overlays.

## Future Work
This is the short list of things I intend to make headway on in the next month.
- Saving (most likely via pickle!)
- "Multiplayer"

I'm currently active and trying to work on this project daily. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue. This project will no longer be p[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/) compliant upon other people thinking it feels nice to use, and all the rules from Mappa Imperium are implemented robustly. What that means, I have yet to find out.
